In Mongo DB, we see _id property as ObjectID("njsndjansd")

The reason for this is that the _id is a binary of 12 bytes length, and converting it to a string would mean doubling its data size (to 24 bytes)
(this can be checked by _id.id.toHexString().length)

That's why the id is enclosed as ObjectID function

Mongoose JS is an ODM (Object Document Mapper)
