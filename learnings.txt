In Mongo DB, we see _id property as ObjectID("njsndjansd")

The reason for this is that the _id is a binary of 12 bytes length, and converting it to a string would mean doubling its data size (to 24 bytes)
(this can be checked by _id.id.toHexString().length)

That's why the id is enclosed as ObjectID function

Mongoose JS is an ODM (Object Document Mapper)

REST (REpresentational State Transfer) API
~~

We fetch data using HTTP requests.
They're of two types - GET and POST (sent with a JSON Request)

In both cases, we get a JSON response

Each API is defined by a HTTP method and a path (of the resource)
eg. CREATE API with a POST method to /tasks

READ API with a GET method to /tasks
READ API with a GET method to /tasks/:id (for specific task with the specified ID)

UPDATE API with a PATCH method to /tasks/:id

DELETE API with a DELETE method to /tasks/:id
